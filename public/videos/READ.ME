The ffmpeg command performs a series of video encoding and formatting:
This command takes input.mp4, resizes it to 960px width while preserving aspect ratio,
encodes it using H.264 with high quality (CRF 20), ensures it plays smoothly on the web (faststart),
outputs all frames as I-frames (good for frame accuracy), and ensures maximum compatibility (yuv420p).
The resulting file will be larger than normal due to -g 1.

ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=960:-1 -movflags faststart -vcodec libx264 -crf 20 -g 1 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4
